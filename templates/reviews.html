            <p>Ferret and Goose is an absolute gem! The lakeside setting is stunning, and the food is exceptional. The Gooseberry Glazed Duck was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it perfect for both a romantic dinner and a family gathering. Highly recommend. Will be returning!</p>

            <p>Dining at Ferret and Goose is an unforgettable experience. The attention to detail in both the dishes and the decor is remarkable. The Mushroom Risotto was creamy and rich, a true testament to their commitment to quality local ingredients. The view of the lake at sunset is breathtaking. Five stars!!</p>

            <p>From the moment we arrived at Ferret and Goose, we were enchanted. The ambiance, with its blend of modern elegance and historic charm, is second to none. The dishes are creative and delicious, with a clear emphasis on local, fresh ingredients. Watching the sunset over the lake while enjoying our meal was pure magic.</p>

            <p> Ferret and Goose fell short in many ways. The wait time was excessive, and the food was cold when it finally arrived. The ambiance was nice, but it couldn't compensate for the lackluster meal. The Ferret Mushroom Risotto was underseasoned and boring. I expected much more for the price.</p>

            <p> My experience at Ferret and Goose was a complete disaster from start to finish. We arrived for our reservation only to be told they had no record of it, despite my confirmation email. After waiting for 45 minutes, we were finally seated at a cramped table near the noisy kitchen. Our waiter was rude and inattentive, taking another 30 minutes to take our order. When the food eventually arrived, it was an utter mess. The Stuffed portobello mushrooms was burnt and inedible, and the Ferret Mushroom Risotto was cold and flavorless. To top it off, we found a hair in one of the dishes. We asked to speak with the manager, who was dismissive and unapologetic. The final insult was the exorbitant bill, which they refused to adjust despite the horrible experience. We left feeling utterly disappointed and ripped off. Avoid this place at all costs!</p>

            <p>I can't say enough good things about Ferret and Goose. The service is impeccable, and the menu is innovative and delicious. We had the Seasonal Tasting Menu, and each course was a delight. The lakeside location adds a magical touch. It's my new favorite spot for special occasions.</p>

            <p>0 stars. The food was cold, the wait staff was rude, and to add insult to injury, the company goose bit me on my way out.<p></p>
