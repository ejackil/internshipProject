                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Two years ago, Ferret and Goose was born from the shared dream of childhood friends, John Ferret and Steve Goose. They discovered a picturesque, lakeside location that seemed destined for their culinary vision. The building, a charming old boathouse with weathered wood and large windows, offered stunning views of the tranquil waters and surrounding nature.</p>
                <p>Steve, a talented chef with a passion for farm-to-table cuisine, and John, a charismatic host with a knack for creating inviting spaces, poured their hearts into renovating the boathouse. They preserved its rustic charm while adding modern touches to enhance the dining experience.</p>
                <p>Ferret and Goose quickly became known for its exquisite dishes, like the “Gooseberry Glazed Duck” and “Ferret Mushroom Risotto,” which celebrated the best of local produce. Guests were drawn not only by the delicious food but also by the serene ambiance, where sunsets over the lake provided a breathtaking backdrop to memorable meals. Ferret and Goose became a beloved culinary haven, where every visit was a celebration of nature, friendship, and the joy of good food.</p>
